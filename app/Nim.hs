-- The subtraction game (a variant of the game of nim).
--
-- A game begins with n sticks on the table. A game is played between
-- Alice and Bob. Alice goes first. Alice takes between one and three
-- sticks, then it is Bob's turn, and Bob takes between one and three
-- sticks. They alternate turns until they run out of sticks. The
-- winner is the player who takes the last stick.
